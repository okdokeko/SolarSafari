            <h2>About Dwarf Planet</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the enigmatic world of <span style="color: #e0c989; font-size: 1.1em;">Pluto</span>, a distant
                dwarf planet that continues to captivate our imagination and push the boundaries of our understanding of
                the solar system!</p>
            <p>Discovered in 1930 by astronomer Clyde Tombaugh in Arizona, Pluto has since been the subject of
                fascination and debate, from its reclassification as a dwarf planet in 2006 to the historic flyby by
                NASA's New Horizons spacecraft in 2015.
                Despite its <span style="font-size: 0.7em; text-decoration: underline;">small size</span> and remote
                location at the edge of the solar system, Pluto is a world of remarkable diversity and complexity.
                Its surface is marked by <span style="color: #402e23;">rugged mountains</span>, <span
                    style="color: #4e7350;">vast plains</span>, and <span style="color:#9890f0;">glaciers</span>, all
                shrouded in a thin atmosphere of nitrogen and methane.
                From the heart-shaped region known as Tombaugh Regio to the towering peaks of water ice, Pluto's
                landscape is a testament to the dynamic forces at work in our solar system.
                But Pluto's intrigue extends beyond its surface features.
                Its system of moons, including the largest moon <span
                    style="color: #9399a3; font-size: 1.1em;">Charon</span>, provides insight into the gravitational
                interactions that have shaped the outer reaches of our cosmic neighborhood.</p>
            <p>
                Embark on the ultimate adventure and witness the awe-inspiring beauty of Pluto firsthand.
                A journey to Pluto promises an unforgettable <span style="color: #824caf">solar safari</span> experience
                unlike any other, offering a chance to explore the outer reaches of our solar system and discover the
                wonders of this distant planet.

                Charon <span style="font-size: 0.7em;">(Top left in the image above)</span> is the <span
                    style="font-size: 1.1em;">largest</span> moon relative to its parent body in the solar system. It's
                so large compared to Pluto <span style="font-size: 0.7em;">(Bottom right in the image above)</span> that
                some scientists refer to the two bodies as a double dwarf planet system rather than a planet-moon
                system.
                Charon's surface exhibits several dark spots, the largest of which is informally named Mordor Macula.
                These dark regions are thought to be composed of complex organic compounds, possibly originating from
                the photolysis of methane on Charon's surface.
                <br>
                <br>
                Pluto's other moons, including Styx, Nix, Hydra, Kerberos, and others, are much smaller than Pluto's
                largest moon, Charon, and are thought to be remnants of a collision between Pluto and another object in
                the distant past.
