            <h2>Venus's Surface</h2>

            <p>What makes Venus unique compared to the previous planets is it's unique surface and weather patterns.
                Venus's surface is home to thousands of volcanos, all with unique names and different characteristics, such as a deep canyon named Diana or a rocky area named Aphrodite Terra.
                This planet also offers unique weather patterns, leaning more to the extreme side. It has the hottest surface in the solar system, other than the Sun.
                Overall, Venus can be hostile towards life on the planet, but you can safely travel to this beautiful planet with one of our travel packages that are listed below.
