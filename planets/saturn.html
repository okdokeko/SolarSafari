            <h2>About Saturn</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Saturn! Known for its mesmerizing rings and fascinating moons, Saturn is the second largest planet in our solar system. Its unique golden hue and prominent icy rings make it stand out as one of the most visually striking planets.

            <h2>Saturn's Rings</h2>
            <p>Saturn’s rings are one of its most iconic features. Its rings are made up of ice and rock chunks ranging in size from as small as a grain of sand to as big as a mountain. These rings are around 30 feet thick, and are divided into many groups which each have a unique composition. Each ring orbits Saturn at a different speed. In 1610, Galileo Galilei was the first person to discover Saturn's rings, observing the big and bright rings surrounding the planet.</p>
