            <h2>About Mercury</h2>
            <p class="para">While Mercury may be smallest planet in our solar system, it cetainly does have a lot of character that sets it apart from all the other planets!
            Mercury is the closest planet to our sun so it has tempuratures that reflect this. During the day (which lasts 29.5 days Earth time!) the surface can get as hot has 
                <b>800 degrees F</b> or as cold as <b>-300 degrees F</b> during the nighttime.
                Its surface is marked by rugged terrain, including towering cliffs and vast plains. Despite its small size, Mercury offers a wealth of geological wonders, 
                providing valuable insights into the processes that shape planetary bodies. Studying Mercury not only sheds light on its own mysteries but also helps us understand the broader processes 
                at work in our solar system. 
                So, as we embark on our journey through the cosmos, let us marvel at the intriguing complexities of this nearby world and the lessons it holds for us as explorers of the universe!

                <h2>What does Mercury look like</h2>
                <p class="para">Many people have wondered what this rocky planet will have in store for them. Well you're in luck! The Solar Safari cruise ship will take us sailing right
                    on by for a once in a lifetime view! Here, you will get to experience the wonders of of a beutiful deep gray formed from the oceans of lava that spent millions of years cooling!
                    Between that and the intricate white streaks formed from craters it is an awe inspiring sight! You will aslo get the chance to look through the lens of old Earth astronomers 
                    using a special chemical map to portray chemical concententrations on the surface!

                <h2>Mercury's Orbit</h2>
                <p class="para">Mercuty's orbit is one of the most chaotic in the solar system. With a highly eliptical path, bringing the planet around
                    the sun in an oval. This causes Mercury to get very close to the sun when it reaches its perihelion and farther away at its aphelion. This is the main cause of the tempurature variation 
                    mentioned earlier. In a way, Mercury has its own seasons! (Except summer is much hotter and winter is much colder!)
